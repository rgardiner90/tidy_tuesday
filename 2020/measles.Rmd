measles <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-25/measles.csv')

## Analyses

1. Get averages by state (find those with lower rates)
2. Look at the exemptions (xrel, xmed, xper). 
3. Plot the schools. 
  - For a state that has lower rates of enrollment, plot the schools to see if there are any trends geographically within the state (is Southern California worse than Northern/Central California).
4. If there is enough variation, try to do an analysis (probably too small when aggregated to do a regression) with having ideology (Berry measure) play a role.
