```{r}

## Analyses

1. Check out tidyverts family (3 packages): https://tidyverts.org/
  - They have a book about forcasting that looks really interesting: https://otexts.com/fpp3/
2. Treat hotel as a potential explainer (look for differences)
3. Look at is_cancelled
4. do some stuff with dates.
5. Look at families with 2 adults and 2 kids (for variation also do babies)
6. Look at how often the types of meals are.
7. look at changes to market_segment over time (I would expect direct to move up and anything with TA to go down)
